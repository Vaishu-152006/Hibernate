Event Volunteer Scheduling System

The Event Volunteer Scheduling System is a Java console-based application developed using Hibernate ORM and Oracle Database to manage volunteers and event shifts efficiently.

The system allows users to:

Register new volunteers

Create event shifts

Assign volunteers to shifts

Prevent overlapping shift assignments

Maintain data validation and database integrity

The application follows a layered architecture with entity, service, and utility classes, using Hibernate for object-relational mapping and sequence-based ID generation for Oracle compatibility.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Hibernate ORM concepts including entity mapping, relationships, transactions, and exception handling.
